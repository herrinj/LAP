README.md for the LAP repo

This repo contains MATLAB functions and scripts to run examples using the Linearize and Project (LAP) method. All codes rely heavily on the FAIR toolbox available here: https://github.com/C4IR/FAIR.m . This toolbox is required in the MATLAB filepath to run any of the examples in this repo. 

The LAP method and examples in this repo are taken from the paper: 
LAP: A LINEARIZE AND PROJECT METHOD FOR SOLVING INVERSE PROBLEMS WITH COUPLED VARIABLES
